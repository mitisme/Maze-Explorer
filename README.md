# Maze Explorer
Maze Explorer is a Flutter application that allows users to generate and explore random mazes. 
The app offers customizable settings for rows, columns, and exploration delay using text boxes.
This is a good way to understand how DFS works out its problems as you can watch it explore the maze.
